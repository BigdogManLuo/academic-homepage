## About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am skilled in time-series forecasting and mathematical optimization modeling. I also maintain a personal blog where I document hands-on experiments, implementation notes, and reflections on data analysis, machine learning for energy and power systems.
